# Browser Extensions and Tricks for Extra Halal Browsing

## Ads

### [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)

Ads often feature non-mahrams and unislamic content. This extension suffices to block them all.

## Youtube

### [Unhook](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid?hl=en&pli=1)

YouTube can be a gateway to various forms of fitna, such as following un-Islamic personalities or trends and accessing inappropriate content. This extension helps block the parts of YouTube that make it easy to fall into these fitan, allowing you to use it in a way that aligns with your needs.

Make sure to:
- Hide ‘Home Feed'
- Redirect to Subscriptions 
- Hide ‘Recommended'
- Hide ’Shorts'
- Hide ‘Comments’ (Lots of videos have bots comment on them with pornographic images as their profile picture-that’s why hiding comments would be a good idea. You can always unhide them when it’s important)
- Hide ‘Inapt Search Results'
- **Hide ‘Explore, Trending’** (This one is really important. ’Trending’ videos can influence you very effectively)
- Hide ‘More From Youtube'

## Images

### [Tahir](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tahir/ihmoammkfbdpokfiiifajdkfglmfejca?hl=en)

Websites often contain images of non-mahrams, so it's advisable to keep images covered until you need to see them. This extension, Tahir, overlays a blur on all images, which you can toggle on or off (or selectively unblur a single image), allowing you to avoid images you don't want to see.

### [Wizmage Image Hider](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wizmage-image-hider/ifoggbfaoakkojipahnplnbfnhhhnmlp?hl=en)

Some websites, such as BBC, consistently feature problematic images. For these sites, you may want to automatically blur all images, except those you choose to unblur. Wizmage allows you to do this, offering site-specific control. This is different from Tahir, which functions as a universal image blocker that you can toggle on and off at any time, regardless of the website.

These files will block over 10 million haram websites.

#### Distracting Content

You can also add individual domains that you find problematic or distracting into your Hosts file. The tutorial on how to do so is here:

- [On Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM60R9dWYUI)
- [On Mac](https://youtu.be/7EiecYhhuss?feature=shared&t=191)

Furthermore, to block distracting websites from showing up in your Google search results (such as Reddit), get the extension [uBlacklist](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe?hl=en) which blocks websites of your choice from showing in your search results. 

## Enhance Arabic Text

For those who like to read in Arabic online, there are extensions to make the Arabic text more readable. 

[Wudooh](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wudooh-%D9%88%D8%B6%D9%88%D8%AD/nigfaloeeeakmmgndbdcijjegolpjfhn?hl=en) will allow you to change the font and font size for any Arabic site. It usually glitches on YouTube, though, so you can put it on the whitelist.

## Quran Tab Page to Replace ’New Tab’ Page

[Quran Tab](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/quran-tab/afaihcdgkjebgabomemccdneglknjkdd?hl=en) is a wholesome extension that shows you an Ayah of the Quran every time you open a new tab.
